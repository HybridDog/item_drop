[Mod] PilzAdam's item_drop mod edited [item_drop]

I edited [PilzAdam's item_drop mod](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=2656).<br/>
* Items are picked when they don't move (thus immediate item picking is fixed).
* When holding sneak, items are not picked.
* Item picking and dropping can be en- and disabled using settings.
* minetest.after instead of globalstep is used, when walking into a crowd of
	items, items are picked one after another because it sounds better than a
	loud pop.
* Players without interact privilege don't pick items.
* Items are not flying to the player (no magnet behaviour).
